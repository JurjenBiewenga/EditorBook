# Intro

This book is an attempt at teaching you Editor Scripting by teaching the fundamentals first before diving into the world of custom editors and property drawers. Knowing the fundamentals before starting with editors and property drawers will help you avoid common pitfalls and hopefully an easier time solving your issues. This book assumes that you have an intermediate knowledge of Unity and programming.
